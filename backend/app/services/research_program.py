    or a blocking gap OPENS A REAL SECTION: the markdown then carries a claim
    heading the platform never emitted, and any consumer that splits the
    document on ``## `` attributes the forged text to a section builder.

    The plan is not the only such channel.  TOOL-derived strings reach the same
    markdown and are just as model-reachable: ``run_research_matrix`` copies a

    originate outside this module passes through here -- see the sweep listed

    characters, and has its ATX heading markers escaped.  The escape
    is not limited to the start of the line on purpose: a consumer that splits
    the document on the bare substring ``"## Draft Scientific Claim"`` is fooled

    returns, and on the cross-turn fallback path the whole ``tool_results`` list
    is caller text.  The swept fields, by section:
