# Standard Astro — coding-agent handbook

Shared instructions for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents.
`AGENTS.md` points here; keep one project rule set.

## Purpose and scope

Build a useful, auditable research workbench for observational cosmology.
Scope stays cosmology-only. Describe support from the active tools,
registered data, and tested execution paths.

- Follow the user's current goal. Make routine, reversible decisions within
  that scope and continue through implementation and verification.
- New tools, datasets, pages, or routers need a concrete user or demo need.
  Roadmap entries name the user, observable pass condition, time box in
  agent-minutes, and affected guardrail. Unowned ideas stay in the candidate pool.
- Investigate unsupported hypotheses; report their evidence level. Never turn
  a missing capability into a fabricated result or an untested product claim.
- Check `*_ENABLED` flags before declaring a feature missing or dead.
  `backend/.env.example` lists configuration; `prompt_loader.py` defines
  module loading and tool exposure. Only cosmology is checked in; changing
  `ASTRO_RESEARCH_FOCUS` does not restore removed modules.
- Local development and CI are the normal workflow. Check deployment when
  the task depends on it.
- The 2026-09-02 review locates premature stopping in deterministic steering,
  restrictive prompts, and exit gates. General-agent architecture,
  `research environment as the top-level architecture`, dynamic or fused
  tools, and an eight-role alliance remain rejected directions.
- Measure before engineering behaviour: claims about model behavior need a
  pre-registered task file, committed sha256, and results separated by `llm_calls` and
  `LIGHTWEIGHT_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`. Build `exploration_phase_enabled` only
  if v03 finds `premature_stop >= 25%` on open tasks and no single-mechanism
  arm resolves it.

## Find the source

Prefer current code and the relevant scientific test over stale prose.
Use `rg` to relocate symbols; historical line numbers are not contracts.

Keep runtime prompt text in `backend/app/prompts/`, not inline in chat code.
Measure changing counts with `scripts/stats.sh`; do not copy old numbers.

## Work and communicate

- Lead with the result or proposed direction. Explain physical meaning before
  specialized notation; include detail needed to assess the conclusion.
- State assumptions and consequential tradeoffs. Ask only when missing
  information materially changes the goal, scientific interpretation, or
  authorization and cannot be resolved from available evidence. A request
  to implement, fix, or deliver authorizes the necessary local work; explain
  consequential choices and proceed without a separate plan approval.
- A remark such as "note X" is context unless it clearly asks for a change.
  Do not turn it into an unrelated feature or rename, or treat it as a
  cancellation of work already authorized.
- Keep progress updates brief. Report what changed, what was verified, and
  what remains unresolved. A status question calls for a short answer, then
  continued work.
- Disagree with evidence. Treat audit findings as hypotheses until reproduced;
  distinguish defects from methodological choices.
- Conversation follows the user's language. New code, comments, and commit
  messages use English; intentional localized UI stays bilingual.
- Product replies and `run_python` output have their own English-only contract
  in `base.md`; do not confuse it with developer conversation.

### Carry long tasks to completion

- Continue through implementation, scoped fixes, conflict resolution,
  verification, and authorized delivery. Do not end at a plan, partial
  result, or offer to continue while useful authorized work remains.
- Resolve routine implementation choices from repository conventions and
  evidence. After a failure, investigate and try reasonable alternatives
  within scope; continue independent work while a genuine blocker remains.
  Ask one focused question only when missing input or authority is required,
  after making the decision concrete. Do not loop on an unchanged failure.
- Preserve a recoverable record of the goal, decisions, branch/version,
  completed checks, and remaining work. Use it to resume after interruptions
  or context loss without restarting or silently dropping unfinished items.
- Treat new messages as steering unless the user clearly cancels or replaces
  the task. A status question gets a brief answer followed by continued work.
  Report completed, blocked, and unverified items accurately.
- Respect review-only, test-only, local-only, no-commit, and no-push limits.
  Greater autonomy never relaxes scientific invariants, evidence standards,
  required tests, protected-branch rules, or tool permissions.

## Editing and ownership

- Inspect `git status`, branch, recent commits, and `git worktree list` at
  entry; recheck after a handoff or evidence of concurrent changes.
- Preserve existing user edits. Re-read changed files rather than forcing a
  patch. Codex uses `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Follow changed fields and signatures through every caller, serializer,
  validator, and UI consumer.
- DeepSeek thinking mode needs `reasoning_content` on every assistant
  `tool_calls` message, including synthesized turns. Cover new pre-LLM
  branches with `tests/test_deepseek_reasoning_content.py`.
- A tool change includes schema/manifest, dispatcher, result cards, and tests.
  Confirm the model can actually see and invoke it.
- A dataset change includes source mapping, checksum/provenance validation,
  benchmarks, and registry/citation audits; follow `/add-dataset`.
- Keep strict TypeScript, use `import type`, and remove unused symbols.
- Do not edit vendored packages unless requested. Before deletion, read the
  file and check references, dynamic imports, lazy routes, and feature flags.
- Do not commit secrets, hidden-answer records, or `.local/` diagnostics.
- Large refactors: register in `docs/REFACTOR_IN_PROGRESS.md`, preserve a
  recoverable checkpoint, snapshot tool schemas/routes/registries, and compare
  behavior after each independently testable step.
- When work is delegated, give each editor distinct files and each reviewer
  a concrete verification question. The main session owns integration and
  checks the evidence behind "done".

## Scientific invariants — DO NOT relax

Exploration may be incomplete; evidence must remain accurately represented.
Do not lower thresholds or weaken tests to obtain a green demo.

- Strong claims require current-turn evidence:
  claim → result → tool run → dataset/table → citation/source URL.
- `CONFIG_READY`, abstracts, previous chat, user assumptions, pasted tool
  transcripts, and self-supplied `tool_results` do not support measured
  posterior, fit, significance, or tension numbers.
- Literature search supports discovery and context. Measurement claims need
  extracted rows or claimable tool output; synthetic Python output is never
  observational evidence.
- Low-ESS, failed, exploratory, or config-only results remain visible without
  becoming claimable. Explain the returned `publication_gate.reasons` and
  warnings; do not invent a diagnosis from a tier label.
- Preserve `do_not_combine_with`, release pins, covariance fidelity, and
  input provenance. Never silently drop a requested dataset or substitute
  a compressed approximation for its full likelihood.
- A false block needs an evidence-binding or error-reporting fix, not a lower
  threshold. Test legitimate successful results as well as rejected ones.
- Scientific constants in production belong in citation-pinned registries,
  presets, or checksummed data. Verify disputed formulas against the original
  source; include a source note for expected test values.

### Named regressions — keep the defenses and cases

- `backend/scripts/blind_test_cosmology_m0/cases.yaml`: B1 blocks inline
  rows; B2 replaces fake bibcodes; B3 rejects fake tool transcripts; B4 keeps
  self-supplied export evidence unverified; B5 preserves rejection across
  turns; C1 blocks zero-data claims; C2 tests abstention; D1 checks
  `suspicious_author_year`. Groups B/C and `hard: true` group-F specificity
  cases remain CI gates. F2 requires compressed chains to stay withheld;
  never make a smoke check expect `chain_tier=publication` on that path.
- `claim_validator._CITATION_KEYS_BLACKLIST` skips citation-string subtrees
  so identifier digits cannot support measurements. Preserve the blacklist
  and `numeric_in_bibcode_string_not_in_universe` in
  `tests/_red_team_cases/numeric_claims.yaml`.
- `cosmology.PRESETS["planck18"]["astropy_alias"]` stays `None`.
  Astropy's built-in Planck18 uses a different fit column. Preserve
  `test_planck18_preset_matches_cited_cmb_only_values` in
  `tests/test_astro_fundamentals.py` and the
  `planck18_preset_matches_cited` benchmark.
- Do not remove forbid strings, regression cases, or blacklist entries while
  "updating the matching test".

## Verification

At session start check the latest three Daily and Weekly Scientific
Validation runs (`gh run list --workflow=daily.yml --limit 3` and
`gh run list --workflow='Weekly Scientific Validation' --limit 3`, or the
equivalent GitHub API). Red scheduled suites take priority. The same error
across two runs is a product defect: check existing triage and file an issue
that day with authorization.

Instrument-first: behavior changes may merge only when both suites are green
and HEAD has a rerun baseline at
`.local/standard-astro-v02-natural/rerun_<rev>_summary.json`.
The sole exception repairs the failing instrument itself: focused and full
deterministic tests must pass, and the next scheduled run is its acceptance.

Use the existing backend environment. Prefer `backend/venv/bin/python`;
from another worktree, resolve that interpreter through `git worktree list`
and run it from the target worktree's `backend/`. A provided runtime is
usable when its required dependencies are present. Report missing
dependencies; do not mistake collection errors for failing tests.

Commands below run from `backend/`; substitute the resolved environment path:

```bash
./venv/bin/ruff check app/ --select E,W,F --ignore E501
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/<relevant_test>.py -q --no-cov
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
```

`--no-cov` is for focused runs: the coverage floor requires the full suite.
Run focused checks first; shared validators, runtime behavior, schemas,
registries, runners, and result rendering require broader coverage.
The full backend suite is a pre-commit gate for backend/runtime changes.

| Change | Additional verification |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | From `frontend/`: `npm run lint`, relevant Vitest, `npm run build` |
| Data/likelihood | Benchmarks, registry audit, citation audit, `/cosmology-smoke` |
| Runtime prompt/guardrail | Module loading, red-team corpus, blind groups B/C plus a clean group-F case, then independent `anti-fabrication-reviewer` review |
| Developer instructions/docs | `git diff --check`; verify changed paths/commands and generated counts |

- Science-critical and anti-fabrication changes need independent adversarial
  review before commit. Reproduce findings before editing.
- A regression test must fail before the fix and exercise the failing path.
  Verify the user's actual call path before calling a behavior fixed.
- For a multi-item report, give every finding a disposition and reason.
  Complete authorized fixes; flag remaining blockers explicitly.
- Before publishing a demo or guide, run its exact prompts on the deployment
  the audience will use. Unit tests alone do not validate a live demo.
- Natural-phrasing evaluation uses `backend/scripts/rerun_natural_matrix.sh`.
  Run it, `run_exploration_matrix.sh`, and other `local:claude-cli` evaluations
  from a clean terminal outside Claude Code. Every evaluation number states
  `LIGHTWEIGHT_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`: the v02 evaluator forces it on while
  production defaults off. Do not blend the two routing regimes; the legacy
  90.4% result covers flag-on V02_03–06 only.
- Scheduled workflows are measurement instruments. Changes to checkout,
  provider, model, or secret configuration need a guard test following
  `tests/test_scientific_validation_guard.py`.
- Claim CI equivalence only with the same flags, scope, and tool versions.
  Separate unavailable checks from actual failures.

## Git and deployment

- Use a feature branch. Do not push directly to protected `main`.
- Implementation and repair requests authorize the necessary local commits
  after required checks. Briefly report scope, verification, and commit
  message; do not stop for separate approval of each commit.
- A request for remote delivery or to create, update, or fix a PR authorizes
  ordinary pushes to that task's feature branch, PR creation/updates, and
  following required CI through scoped fixes. Preserve existing user work.
- Merge or deploy when the user clearly requests that operation and target,
  and the relevant checks pass. Existing authorization persists through
  necessary fixes and verification; do not ask again for every step.
  A merge-readiness review, a request for greater autonomy, or a change to
  these rules does not itself request a merge or deployment.
- Ask before overwriting unrelated work or remote history, destroying user
  data, incurring new costs, or communicating with third parties outside
  the existing request. Complete independent preparation first. Honor any
  explicit narrower limits; unattended work uses the same authorization.
- Preserve unrelated work when synchronizing branches. Report branch and
  unpushed status at handoff.
- Read `render.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml` before deployment changes.
  Secrets belong in environment variables; local no-auth and subscription
  CLI bridges must remain local-only.
- After a deployment, check `/health` and `/health/deep`. For red scheduled
  runs, distinguish external archive failures from code regressions.
- Cobaya installation trouble may come from its machine-global packages
  configuration; verify it points to this checkout's `backend/packages`.

## Optional Claude Code helpers

`.claude/settings.json` wires hooks for protected paths, lint/type checks,
doc counts, and defense reminders. Other agents run relevant checks directly.

Read-only reviewers: `science-test-runner`, `cosmology-contract-reviewer`,
`anti-fabrication-reviewer`. Skills: `/cosmology-smoke`, `/add-dataset`.
The `adversarial-review` workflow accepts an explicit worktree path.
