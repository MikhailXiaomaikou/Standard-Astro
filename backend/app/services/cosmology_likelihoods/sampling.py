    therefore proposed jointly from the linearized prior
    (``_planck_dp_lcdm_proposal_moments``); for flat extended-DE models the
    ombh2/ns axes get independent Table-I-anchored Gaussians (the DE target
    is degeneracy-widened anyway and relies on the emcee upgrade).  Proposal
    densities are subtracted exactly, so these anchors can never bias the
