# Standard Astro API Reference

Standard Astro uses FastAPI, which auto-generates interactive API documentation.

## Interactive Documentation

| Interface | URL | Best For |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Swagger UI** | `{backend-url}/docs` | Testing endpoints interactively |
| **ReDoc** | `{backend-url}/redoc` | Reading documentation |
| **OpenAPI JSON** | `{backend-url}/openapi.json` | Machine-readable schema |

## Authentication

Authenticated account, workspace, session, and team endpoints require a JWT token in the `Authorization` header. Chat and some data-search endpoints also accept optional auth for beta/local usage:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

Obtain a token via:
- `POST /api/auth/login` -- email + password login
- `POST /api/auth/setup-key-login` -- beta setup key login
- `POST /api/auth/google` -- Google OAuth login

## Key Endpoints

### Health & Monitoring

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Service status + version |
| GET | `/health/deep` | Deployment readiness: Alembic head, persistent mount/object storage, Redis broker, Celery worker |
| GET | `/health/stats` | Uptime, request counts, error rate, top endpoints (admin only) |
| GET | `/health/detailed` | Authenticated DB, broker, storage and external-service probe results |
| GET | `/metrics` | Prometheus text metrics, including provenance-v2 connector and citation counters |
| GET | `/api/admin/inference/stats` | AI model usage statistics (tokens, latency, cost) (admin only) |
| GET | `/api/admin/inference/health` | AI backend connection status (admin only) |

### Data Access

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/data/search` | Multi-source astronomical search |
| GET | `/api/data/workspace` | List workspace files |
| POST | `/api/data/fits/upload` | Upload FITS file (returns type detection) |
| GET | `/api/data/fits-header?fits_path=...` | Read FITS headers + HDU structure |
| POST | `/api/integration/votable/upload` | Upload + convert VOTable to FITS |

There is no public ADQL HTTP endpoint: `POST /api/integration/adql/query` was
removed on 2026-06-11 with the M3 frontend trim. ADQL execution now happens
only through the chat assistant's `run_adql` tool.

The source registry currently exposes 23 connector keys. The active provenance-v2 sources are `vizier`, `gaia`, `simbad`, `ned`, `2mass`, and `alma`; the other 17 keys return an `UNAVAILABLE` maintenance payload instead of executing legacy connector code. ALMA is active for Science Archive observation metadata only, not derived line luminosity or FWHM measurements. Direct SDSS SQL (`run_sdss_sql`) is gated the same way until it emits independent `archive_version` provenance. The solar-system (`jpl`/`mpc`) and exoplanet (`nasa_exoplanet_archive`) connectors — which backed the `fetch_horizons_ephemeris`, `query_mpc_orbit`, and exoplanet-archive tools — were extracted to the sibling standard-astro-verticals repo on 2026-06-03, so they are no longer registered here. `ASTRO_RESEARCH_FOCUS` now fails closed to cosmology for any value other than `all` (see DEPLOYMENT.md), so `solar_system` / `exoplanet` no longer surface a distinct allowlist in this repo.

### AI Assistant

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/chat/message` | Send message (single JSON response) |
| POST | `/api/chat/message/stream` | SSE streaming chat endpoint used by the frontend agent loop |
| GET | `/api/chat/ai_backend_status` | Reports whether server-side or browser-provided AI backends are available |
| GET | `/api/chat/sessions` | List chat sessions |
| GET | `/api/chat/sessions/{session_id}` | Get session messages |

When `LIGHTWEIGHT_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=1`, qualifying chat turns may include
the model-visible `verify_scalar_derivation` tool. It is deliberately bounded
to `ratio`, `difference`, `product`, and inverse-covariance
`weighted_mean`; it does not accept arbitrary expressions or execute generated
code. Inputs require explicit quantities, units, standard uncertainties,
source references/locators, and one of `independent`, `correlation_matrix`, or
`covariance_matrix`.

The resulting receipt exposes these stable semantics:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `task_kind` | `deterministic_source_check` |
| `calculation_status` | Whether the controlled derivation ran successfully |
| `source_status` | `verified_exact`, `resolved_unmatched`, `user_supplied_unverified`, `conflict`, or `unavailable` |
| `claim_scopes` | Separately authorizes the derived number and the source-measurement attribution |
| `response_disposition` | The scalar tool returns `full`, `limited`, or `abstention`; the enclosing chat validation may also return `refusal` or `hard_block` |
| `receipt_sha256` | Canonical hash of the receipt payload |

Source adapters support arXiv, DOI, Zenodo, public HTTPS URLs, and explicitly
unverified user-supplied comparators. Public downloads are size/time bounded;
HTTPS redirects and resolved addresses are revalidated to keep private-network
targets outside the source resolver. A `verified_exact` receipt verifies the
requested labels and values in the scoped source region. It does not validate
the paper's method or make the result publication-ready.

### Pipeline

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/pipeline/run` | Execute an authenticated pipeline DAG; every file input is owner-bound before dispatch |
| POST | `/api/pipeline/batch-run` | Authenticated batch execution on owner-bound inputs (up to 200) |
| GET | `/api/pipeline/{run_id}` | Get run status + results |
| GET | `/api/pipeline/templates` | List saved pipeline templates |

### Export

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/export/run/{id}/notebook` | Export as Jupyter notebook |
| GET | `/api/export/run/{id}/csv` | Export as CSV |
| GET | `/api/export/run/{id}/votable` | Export as VOTable |
| GET | `/api/export/run/{id}/fits` | Export as FITS |
| GET | `/api/export/run/{id}/publication-package` | All formats in one response |

### Citations & Literature

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/citations/ads?object_name=M31` | Search NASA ADS by object |
| GET | `/api/citations/search?q=...` | Free-text literature search |
| GET | `/api/citations/bibtex?bibcode=...` | Export BibTeX |

### Provenance

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/provenance/{id}/lineage` | Data lineage graph |
| GET | `/api/provenance/{id}/export/ivoa` | IVOA ProvDM XML |
| GET | `/api/provenance/{id}/doi-metadata` | DataCite-ready metadata (content-addressed URN; no DOI is minted) |
| GET | `/api/provenance/{id}/requirements.txt` | Pinned environment |

Tool results also carry inline provenance. The backward-compatible top-level fields (`reproducibility`, `data_origin`, `analysis_status`, `source_urls`, `archive_ids`, `warnings`) remain, and provenance-v2 adds a nested `provenance` object with `datasets`, `field_bibcodes`, `coverage`, and copied reproducibility metadata. Generated papers and the frontend acknowledgement button read from this nested object.

Chat validation summaries may additionally contain `evidence_receipts` for
dataset-coverage checks, untrusted pasted transcripts, capability gaps, and
scalar derivations. The frontend renders these separately from ordinary tool
cards so that a useful derived number can remain visible even when its paper
attribution is limited.

For literature-derived measurement workflows, `search_literature` is paper/abstract-level evidence only. Measurement claims such as line-luminosity/FWHM slopes, intercepts, intrinsic scatter, and correlation values require extracted table rows or a publication-ready fit result in the same tool turn. Built-in cosmology presets likewise do not make their manifest bibcodes globally citeable; the relevant cosmology or fit tool must return the preset provenance in the current turn.

### Team & Collaboration

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/team/members` | List team members |
| POST | `/api/team/invite` | Invite member |
| POST | `/api/team/pipelines/{template_id}/share` | Share pipeline template |
| POST | `/api/team/datasets/{file_id}/share` | Share dataset |
