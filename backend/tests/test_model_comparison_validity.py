"""compute_model_comparison validity guards + research-matrix comparison flow.

History:
- 2026-06-11: cross-representation guard. planck2018_compressed is a
  model-DEPENDENT compressed representation: extended flat-DE chains swap its
  diagonal ΛCDM posterior summary for the Chen-Huang-Wang (R, l_A, ombh2)
  distance prior, which adds an ombh2 sampled axis. An lcdm-vs-wcdm pair on
  that selection compares chi2 against two DIFFERENT likelihoods — the deltas
  are not a model comparison.
- 2026-06-12 (user decision): the phase-1 matrix gate was OPENED for flat-DE
  extensions (wcdm/w0wa_cdm run numerically via the emcee upgrade) while
  curvature/neutrino-mass branches stay config_only and point to the CMB
  path. Opening the gate exposed a second validity hole: a chain_tier=
  'blocked' fit (ESS collapse) used to feed a confident preferred-model
  verdict. compute_model_comparison now fails closed on blocked inputs too.
- 2026-07-07: planck2018_compressed now executes the SAME correlated CHW2019
  distance-prior representation on every flat model (ΛCDM included), so the
  lcdm-vs-wcdm pair on desi+planck is no longer cross-representation — it
  became a genuinely valid comparison. The representation guard itself is
  unchanged and stays covered by a synthetic mismatch fixture below.

All guards keep the factual deltas reported (they are real numbers from real
fits); only the preference verdict is withheld.
