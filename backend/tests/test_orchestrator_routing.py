"""Golden-set tests for Orchestrator.classify_intent.

Plan Tier B1: lock in the routing behavior on a 30-query hand-written
suite so regressions to the regex classifier (or any future LLM
fallback) become visible in CI instead of at demo time.

Each query declares which agents MUST appear in the classification.
Classifier may return additional agents; we only assert the required
ones are present. The goal isn't 100% purity — it's preventing drift.
