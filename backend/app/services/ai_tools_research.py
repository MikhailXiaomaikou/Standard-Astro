"""Research-program AI tools — extracted from ai_tools/__init__.py
(H1 split, 2026-05-26).

5 thin-wrapper tools over app.services.research_program: plan_research_program,
run_research_matrix, build_evidence_graph, verify_research_facts,
export_research_report. No shared ai_tools helpers are needed.

(research_workflow and full_research_report remain in ai_tools/__init__ for now:
the former is a large multi-step orchestrator, the latter has no standalone
executor.)

Dispatch mirrors the other sibling modules: ai_tools/__init__ routes
``tool_name in RESEARCH_TOOL_NAMES`` to ``dispatch_research``.

    """Resolve the tool_results evidence for the render/verify research tools.

    When the chat agent loop dispatched this call, it ALWAYS injects the
    turn's real accumulator as ``_turn_tool_results`` (the dispatcher strips
    any model-supplied copy of that key, so the model cannot forge it). The
    server record is then the ONLY admissible evidence — model-supplied
    ``tool_results`` were previously rendered verbatim into the report /
    fact-check, letting a fabricated ``{publication_ready: true, H0: ...}``
    payload become a user-facing deliverable AND re-ground its own numbers
    via the result text (live-confirmed bypass, 2026-06-12). Direct
    library/test callers (no injection) keep their payload — trusted code.

    Returns (tool_results, warnings, source_label). source_label is one of:
      - "server_turn_record": a NON-EMPTY trusted accumulator was injected;
        it is authoritative and any caller-supplied payload is ignored.
      - "caller_supplied_unverified": the chat path injected an EMPTY record
        (no tool produced results THIS turn) but the caller supplied a
        payload — ambiguous between an honest cross-turn echo of prior real
        results and a same-turn fabrication, which the server cannot tell
        apart. The draft is rendered from the caller payload so a legitimate
        "now export what we found" follow-up is not a blank report (review
        #13), but the output is stamped __do_not_claim__ so its numbers
        cannot ground claims (laundering stays closed).
